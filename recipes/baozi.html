    <h2>What Is a Bao Bun?</h2>
    <p>The answer is more complex than you might think. If you say “bao buns” to someone who grew up in a Chinese household, they might give you a quizzical look. The word “bao” in Chinese (包) essentially means bun, so the phrase “bao bun” is not very descriptive. Instead, there is a wide variety of bao types. The one most people think of is called Baozi, a steamed bun with a savory filling, and is the recipe I’ll share today. Other popular types of bao are Cha Shao Bao (barbeque pork bun), Sheng Jian Bao (pork buns that are pan-fried after steaming), Gua Bao (popularized in America by chef David Chang) and Xiao Long Bao (known as soup dumplings in the U.S.).</p>
